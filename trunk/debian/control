Description: GTK+ client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
 Ario is a full featured client for MPD (Music Player Daemon).
 The interface used to browse the library is inspired by Rhythmbox but Ario
 aims to be much lighter and faster.
 It uses GTK2, Gconf to store configurations and curl to download remote
 files (like cover arts).
